with</h2>
<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 18pt; font-family: Arial;" align="center">WP Symposium Toolbar</h1>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;">The
present page is a quick
introduction to the plugin options page. It aims at completing the WP
Help tabs in a non size-constrained and little less formal way, by
further developing the help and providing hints, do’s,
don’t’s...
</p>
<h2 style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16pt;">1. Roles</h2>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;">As a
foreword, I would like to point out a few ideas behind the roles when
using WPS Toolbar. Some of the settings of the plugin are defined on a
per-role basis, hence roles are listed there. In addition to the roles
that are defined on your site, you will find within these settings,
roles that don't correspond to anything but are, instead,&nbsp;used
internally by this plugin.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;">The first
pseudo-role is called "Visitor". As its name states, this role is used
by the plugin
to qualify non-users of your site or network of sites. Use this role to
show the Toolbar and
some of its items to your site's visitors and non logged-in users, along with custom menus.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;">In
addition to "Visitor", Multisites Admins will find checkboxes called
"User". These are used to qualify users of the network that may not be member
of the browsed site, hence have no role / no capability on this site.
You may use this role to display specific navigation items, like a link
to the Register page so they can subscribe to the&nbsp;site, as well as links to WP Symposium pages somewhere
else in the network. Of course if you haven't activated Multisites, you
will not see this pseudo-role.</p>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">We'll now
browse&nbsp;the tabs at the
plugin options page, one after the other..</p>
<h2 style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16pt;">2. Toolbar</h2>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">The
first set of options will allow
you to select which of the default WP Toolbar items should be
displayed, for each role of your site : at this
tab, like at some other tabs of this plugin options page, you have to
select which roles will see
which item. An important thing to stress, is that the plugin
will not enforce the rules used by WordPress to let users access to
information, and this is reflected by the rows of roles under each item
at this tab. Most of these items will not be accessible to
everybody, but to some of the roles only. We
will now browse some of the
options available here...</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 13pt;">2.1. WP Toolbar</h3>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;">The key
option is the very first one of the tab. If your aim is to
completely hide the WP Toolbar, regardless of members roles, you should
probably look for another option: WPS Toolbar can do that, indeed, and
will do what you ask it to do, but there are other, easier and lighter
ways to hide the Toolbar without putting this whole plugin into action.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 12pt;">2.2. WP Logo</h3>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">The
WP Logo can be used as a menu location : for
a given role, if you choose to hide the WP Logo menu but attach a
custom menu to it, your menu will <span style="font-style: italic;">replace</span>
the default WordPress menu.
If you choose to show the default menu, your custom menu will be
<span style="font-style: italic;">appended</span> to
it.</p>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Moreover,
when
replacing the WP Logo menu, it is mandatory to use a custom menu
contained in one single toplevel item that will be attached to the
Toolbar, otherwise the first parentless item will be used as parent for
any further parentless item. Make your own experience here...</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 13pt;">2.3. Comments Bubble</h3>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;">By default
WordPress never hides the Comments bubble, even when there is
no comment to handle. If you do know that you'll never
receive any comments since you have deactivated those from the posts
settings, you could hide the icon from here so that it never
shows.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 13pt;">2.4. Author Links</h3>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;">By
author's links, I mean the Add New, the Shortlink and the Modify
links. If your theme provides such links lower in the page and you wish
to avoid duplication, you could hide them from here.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 13pt;">2.5. WP User Menu</h3>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">This
menu is also called "My Account" in WordPress litterature and
code. It contains information related to the member account.</p>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">If
you wish to replace the default User Menu with your own, you should
uncheck all items of the
WP User Menu from the ad hoc tab, instead of hiding the menu from this
first section. If you hide the WP User Menu here but attach a custom
menu to it, none of the menus will be displayed. Neither will
be
displayed the Howdy message and the avatar in the Toolbar.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 13pt;">2.6. Search Field</h3>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Only
visible on the frontend, a search icon will unfold when clicked, to
reveal the search field. While unfolding, you'll notice that this
pushes the WP User Menu. If you're concerned with menus and other items
being pushed by this icon, rather than removing it you may move it to
the inner of your Toolbar.</p>
<h2 style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16pt;">3. WP
User Menu</h2>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Not
much to add
to the help tab, as its options are relatively straightforward. The
first set of options deal with the menu toplevel item in the
Toolbar, while the second set of options describes how this menu should
look like.
The last option allows you to add extra information to this
menu.</p>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">If
interrested in populating this menu with
custom information, advanced users may refer to the
Developers' Guide available from
the Welcome tab at the plugin options page, to check out the hooks
proposed by the plugin.</p>
<h2 style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16pt;">4. Custom
Menus</h2>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Create
your NavMenus from the WordPress page, then from this tab select the
menu, the location you'd like to attach it to, and the roles you want
to allow
to see this menu.</p>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">You may
add two or
more menus to the same location: they will be shown only to the roles
you have selected. If more than one menu should be shown to a
given role at a given location, they will be appended one to the other,
in the order you have defined them. This can be used to
display
different menu items to different roles: one main menu for all, and
additional items for higher roles. Or, different menus for different
roles. Your choice.</p>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">You may
use
the same menu several times, however, for a given role it will be
displayed only once, even if this page indicates it should be displayed
more than once.</p>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">When using
custom
icons with your menus, it is recommended to use only one toplevel item,
otherwise all toplevel items of your menu will be replaced with this
icon. If you wish to have several icons, you should create several
custom menus.</p>
<h2 style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16pt;">5. WP
Symposium</h2>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">On
WP Symposium installations, the plugin adds a dedicated tab for WPS
admins.</p>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">This tab
allows
you to add to the Toolbar, the WPS admin
menu as mirrored from the Dashboard sidebar. Obviously, only admins
will see this menu.</p>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">You
may also choose to display notification icons for mail and friendship
to the Toolbar. These can be added based on member's role.</p>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">On
Multisites Installs, a checkbox will propose you to search for WP
Symposium features accross the whole network. If you leave
this unchecked, the features found locally will be used: if the WPS
Profile isn't activated and a page isn't properly defined on the
subsite, the Friends icon will not show, and the Howdy and User Info
will not link to the WPS Profile page. Likewise,
if the WPS Mail isn't activated locally the mail icon will not show.
When checked, features will be searched&nbsp;on any other site the
user is member of, and if found the icons and links will point to this
site. The search order is: current site, main site, subsite in
ascending ID order.</p>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">The
last checkbox at this tab will re-generate for you the WPS menus
available at the NavMenus page of the WP Dashboard, which were created
upon first activation of the plugin. If it ever appears that
these menus weren't properly created, or if you've modified
them
to the point you've messed up everything, you may ask the plugin to
re-generate them for you. As instructed, delete the menu you'd like to
replace, check this box, and save the options. The plugin will then
re-create missing menus, without modifying the existing ones.</p>
<h2 style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16pt;">6. Styles</h2>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">At this
tab, settings allow
you to
modify the look of the WP Toolbar. A preview mode is available, as well
as a popup message to
remember you to save your settings to make them permanent !</p>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Styling
settings are split into the two main components: the Toolbar itself and
its dropdown menus, each of them being addressed through settings
gathered in two families: one for normal style, and
one for hover / focus. The hover style is used when the mouse
moves over an item, and the focus style is used for an item when a
submenu opens below that item and the mouse follows that menu.
Each of these sections contains subsections dealing with:
background, fonts, borders, shadow,...</p>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">It should
be stressed
here that the plugin uses the native inheritance mechanism of CSS
(Cascading Style Sheets), so that its impact on page load is limited to
the only elements you want to re-style. This means that if you don't
define a given attribute it'll be inherited from either WordPress
Toolbar default attributes, your theme, any other plugin or custom
modification you may have made, or, of course, other settings you will
make in WPS Toolbar.</p>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">There
is no strong rule for this inheritance. Some colours (like the
background and gradient colours) will need to be set and will use WP
default value if there are not. Some other colours (like item
borders or font shadow) will inherit from other colours.
For the fonts, the values of font family / size / attributes
set
by the plugin will be propagated accross the Toolbar and dropdown menus.</p>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">My
advice here, is to proceed from top to bottom, so that you see the
results of settings that were changed 'above' a given element,
otherwise you might add unneeded CSS to your page headers.
It
is better to 'play nicely' with the existing style than fight against
it....</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 13pt;">What is the difference
between "default" and "none" (or "no",
etc.)...</h3>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Every
time you fill a value somewhere in this tab, the plugin will add a
little something to your page header. For dropdown lists, the empty
value is "default", and if you select this value, it won't add
anything, leaving WordPress and your theme decide which value shall be
taken into account. Any other choice will force the page to adopt that
value for that style, including "none" which will force the style to
drop an other value that might have been added by your theme.</p>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">If
you're unsure which of these two values you should select and you can't
see any difference in the preview, it is probably a good idea to keep
the "default".</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 13pt;">How to remove the default
font shadow...</h3>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">As
a reciprocal from the above, if you want to remove a default setting,
you will need to input something in the relevant field of this tab.</p>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">For
instance (and as introduced by the question above), if you'd like to
remove the default WordPress font shadow, you will need to input zeros
in horizontal / vertical fields.</p>
<h2 style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16pt;">7. How
To...</h2>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Some more
answered questions...</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 13pt;">Monochrom dividers or
two-colors borders...?</h3>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">It may not
be perceptible, but WP Toolbar by default uses two
borders, one on each side of its items. The plugin mirrors
this while allowing you to define two-color borders. You may
however, switch to a monochrom divider by <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> defining a
second colour. WPS Toolbar will then adjust those settings so that it
displays nice borders around your Toolbar items.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 13pt;">How to brand my Toolbar?</h3>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">First, you
will need to replace the WP Logo Menu with your
own. This can be achieved in a few steps:</p>
<ul style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">
<li>From the WP Appearance &gt; Menus page, define a
NavMenu with a few links that point to key pages
of your site, like a Contact Form, About Us, Terms &amp;
Conditions,
etc.</li>
<li>Back to the plugin options page, add it to your Toolbar as
a custom menu, to the location
"append / replace WP Logo"</li>
<li>You will very likely want to add your custom icon to this
menu.</li>
<li>From the first tab, uncheck all roles for "WP Logo" meaning
your custom
menu will replace it.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">And
finally, you should consider different style settings for
your
Toolbar, so that it reflects the graphic chart of your site.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 13pt;">Why are you using an
uppercased name for this 'Toolbar'?</h3>
<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">It
designates the toolbar that comes with WordPress. It's the
name given by WordPress so it's not mine, nor it is any toolbar, it's
WordPress Toolbar.</p>
