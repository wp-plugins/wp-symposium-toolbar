== Installation ==

If you are installing for the first time, create a folder called wp-symposium-toolbar in your path-to/wp-content/plugins folder.
Download the ZIP file from wordpress.org, extract its content and upload it into the wp-symposium-toolbar folder.
It is important you call the folder wp-symposium-toolbar and copy the contents of the ZIP file into that folder. 

Alternatively, use the WordPress feature to install the plugin from the WP Dashboard.

A WP Symposium Toolbar plugin should then be available for you to activate in WordPress dashboard.

*Upgrade Notice*

If you are upgrading manually, make a copy of your current wp-symposium-toolbar plugin folder just in case anything goes wrong. Then follow the above steps: download the zip file, extract and upload the content into the plugin folder.  Make sure you de-activate and re-activate the plugin.

Alternatively, use the WordPress feature to upgrade the plugin from the WP Dashboard.  This process will automatically de-activate and re-activate the plugin.

*Adding the plugin to your site*

You do not add this feature manually, a new options menu will appear in the WP Dashboard, under the WP Symposium settings, called "Toolbar", where you will find a few options for this plugin.

The first activation of the plugin will create default items in the WordPress Toolbar: for users, it'll add menu items under the WP User Menu on the upper right corner of the screen, and notification icons for mails and friend requests close to that WP User Menu. You can then configure these through the WPS Toolbar options page.

It will also add an Admin Menu with links to WP Symposium settings pages, visible only by site admins. The content is that of the WP Dashboard sidebar menu for WP Symposium, you cannot edit it, only show or hide the whole menu.
